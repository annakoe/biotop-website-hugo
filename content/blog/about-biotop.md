## Context

To many, the prospect of pursuing a carreer in academia has become a scary one.
We've all seen idealistic young academics keen on changing how academia works from within, their grand ideas gradually stripped from them  when attempting to balance personal and professional life while trying to meet the demands of tenure track committees and funding agencies.

Science is an endeavour that should be abound with idealism and innovative thinking, yet how come that so many young researchers have become so disillusioned?

We believe that the problem is systemic:

- The **rigid institutional structure** of universities and research centres creates a context where linearity of carreer paths has become a prime selection criterion for success. This quenches innovation, is a source of existential anxiety for young scientists and inhibits interdisciplinarity.

- The ever-expanding spectrum of scientific disciplines and sub-disciplines creates a real **measurement-problem at the heart of science**: How do the bodies that fund science assess quality of scientific output of researchers, whose potentially invaluable work may only be fully comprehended by a handful of people. The answer is an over-reliance on aggregated metrics such as the number of publications in high impact journals, with the result of
a distorted scientific culture that predominantly fosters fashionable and novel research, and lacks incentives to warrant reproducibility of studies and to openly share ideas.

- In light of increasing specialisation, the lack of interdisciplinarity and failure to integrate outreach activities in the research process creates a **communication problem**: Not only does it become increasingly difficult to communicate ones reasearch to scientists within and between fields of scientific inquiry, science is edging away from the broader public. When science fails to communicate the scope and value of the insights it produces, the aforementioned measurement problem becomes aggravated, the very notion of publicly funded research falls under scrutiny, and opportunities for valuable feedback are lost.

- Overall, success in science follows typical rich-get-richer dynamics. An industry that has grown around  supplying science with anything it may need has created substantial **financial barriers**. Overpriced lab-equipment, horrendous publication fees and paywalls in front of publicly funded research articles render it virtually impossible for anyone without the financial backing of a strong and established institution to pursue science.


## Mission Statement

*Biotop is the idea to build an open collective of scientists engaging in the curiosity-driven, cross-disciplinary and collaborative exporation and translation of ideas; it is an experiment trying to reinvent the way we do science.*

## Cornerstones

We are a group of young researchers. Biotop is our attempt at taking our future in science, and in part the future of science into our own hands. It is the idea of conceiving a research insitute/network as an ecosystem/environment that fosters a scientific culture that truly deserves this name. We belive that addressing the aformentioned systemic problems in an integrated manner, will not allow us to tackle the many problems we see in science, but also provide a sound foundation for our own research endeavours.

### Interdisciplinarity & Collaboration

Innovation-friendly, flexible organisiation, flat hierarchy, collaboration in small teams that promote interdisciplinarity.

### Rethinking the Paper & Open Science

Active advocacy and development of a platform of tools to establish a new model of scientific publishing, share research openly, open up the peer-review process and allow the development of more suitable research metrics.

### Integration of Outreach Activities

Closely work with the public, science communication through art, develop visualisation tools to empower the public in the exploration of complex problems (economy, political budgets, scientific problems), citizen science projects that include members of the public as active contributors to research projects.

### Development of Open Lab Equipment
develop open-source lab equipment using accessible technology: 3D printing, robotics to reduce financial barriers.
